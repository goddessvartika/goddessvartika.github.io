                    <p data-aos="fade-right">
                        Siddha Mahayoga is a path of inner transformational journey which begins when a Siddha Guru meets a deserving disciple. As an authorised Siddha Guru, the spiritual head of the Siddha Maha Yoga path, Goddess Vartika, initiates deserving disciples onto the grand Yoga path - Siddha Maha Yoga.
                        Every religious and spiritual journey gradually leads a seeker towards Kundalini Awakening. At this point the actual journey begins, prior to this everything done so far is a mere preparation of the mind and body.
                    </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-right">
                        The safest and easiest method for attaining this state of awakened Kundalini is through Kundalini Shaktipat, this is achieved through the blessings and Sankalp of a Siddha Guru. Once the energy is awakened within a deserving disciple, (s)he is able to experience and live in the awareness of the Self.
                    </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-right">
                        The Guru's grace grace and incessant effort on the part of the disciple are essential components for disciples to realise the divinity within themselves.
                        Once a disciple is initiated onto this path, constant and continuous guidance and support is extended all along the journey.
                    </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-right">
                        Shaktipat Deeksha can be obtained online from Guruji Goddess Vartika from any country of the world.                        
                        Formal Shaktipat initiation is available to all seekers without any restriction on the grounds of religion, age, gender, caste, race, creed. The prerequisite being an intense desire to attain oneness, Nirvana, spiritual awareness. A few health conditions have to be screened before the initiation can be given.

He got married at a very tender age. At this age itself he possessed many spiritual qualities like; detachment from worldly longings and control over his emotions. He traveled extensively and sought many teachers. Finally, he got initiated by Swami Gangadhar Tirth in 1889. When Swamiji came to know that he had many responsibilities, he sent Kali Kishore back home and asked him to restart sadhan once he was free from his worldly responsibilities. After nineteen and a half years, as promised by his Guru, Kali Kishore started experiencing the Divine energy within himself.  Later, he took sanyas deeksha and was named Swami Narayandev Tirth.  He wanted this method of yoga to be accessible to many so he  initiated many disciples during his lifetime.</p>

                    <p data-aos="fade-right">
                        Siddha Mahayoga is a path of inner transformational journey which begins when a Siddha Guru meets a deserving disciple. As an authorised Siddha Guru, the spiritual head of the Siddha Maha Yoga path, Goddess Vartika, initiates deserving disciples onto the grand Yoga path - Siddha Maha Yoga.
                        Every religious and spiritual journey gradually leads a seeker towards Kundalini Awakening. At this point the actual journey begins, prior to this everything done so far is a mere preparation of the mind and body.
                    </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-right">
                        The safest and easiest method for attaining this state of awakened Kundalini is through Kundalini Shaktipat, this is achieved through the blessings and Sankalp of a Siddha Guru. Once the energy is awakened within a deserving disciple, (s)he is able to experience and live in the awareness of the Self.
                    </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-right">
                        The Guru's grace grace and incessant effort on the part of the disciple are essential components for disciples to realise the divinity within themselves.
                        Once a disciple is initiated onto this path, constant and continuous guidance and support is extended all along the journey.
                    </p>
                    <p data-aos="fade-right">
                        Shaktipat Deeksha can be obtained online from Guruji Goddess Vartika from any country of the world.                        
                        Formal Shaktipat initiation is available to all seekers without any restriction on the grounds of religion, age, gender, caste, race, creed. The prerequisite being an intense desire to attain oneness, Nirvana, spiritual awareness. A few health conditions have to be screened before the initiation can be given.
